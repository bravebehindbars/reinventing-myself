          <h1>More</h1>
          <p> R.I.M.S is inspired by the personal experience of a real life tragic event where my son, 17 at the time fell victim to gun violence and nearly died. As a result of his upbringing, living with his grandparents who struggled with addiction and domestic violence as well as having an incarcearted parent he was easily influenced and found comfort on the streets. Its possible if he had access to a safer enviornment with resources and a more positive atmosphere maybe this violent act could have been prevented? </p>
